I"ß<p>Ali Baligh received the B.Sc. degree in Geomatics Engineering from Isfahan University, Isfahan, Iran, and the M.Sc. degree in Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing from K.N. Toosi University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2005 and 2008, respectively. In his master thesis, he has focused on questions of implementation strategies and evaluation of filtering algorithms to extract bare earth from LIDAR data collected from vegetated terrains using Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
Longing to be in the front line of research and study to enhance his knowledge of the world, Ali joined the GeoICT laboratory in January 2013, directed by Dr. Gunho Sohn, where theory and technology are combined to investigate challenging practical problems. He was awarded the Ontario Trillium Scholarship (OTS), which is a significant initiative to attract the most qualified international students to Ontario for their doctoral studies. He is the author of three journal papers and the author or coauthor of ten conference papers which mostly cover data analysis, image and LIDAR data classification, indoor modeling and SLAM issues. Currently, he is a research assistant and with the help of great scholars at York University, Ali is researching on ‚Äú3D Modelling of Indoor Spaces and Layout SLAM using imagery data‚Äù, which has a wide range of applications from Indoor Positioning/Navigation and Building Information Modelling to Security-related systems.</p>
