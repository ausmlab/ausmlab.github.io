I am currently a second-year M.Sc. student at the Department of Earth & Space Science & Engineering, York University, supervised by Prof. Gunho Sohn.  Prior to that, I obtained my B.E. degree from the School of Geodesy & Geomatics Engineering, Wuhan University, in 2017.

My research focuses on object detection, sence segmentation and deep learning, particularly in their application for large-sacle building footprints extraction from aerial or satellite images.
